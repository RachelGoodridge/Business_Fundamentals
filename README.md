## Microsoft vs. Nintendo vs. Sony
By: Rachel Goodridge

## Abstract
To help Microsoft compete against Nintendo and Sony in the gaming world, several data analysis algorithms and data science techniques can be employed. Through exploratory data analysis of game sales and ratings, focus areas were selected depending on the preference for diversification of game availability or improvement of the current gaming niche. Further work such as clustering games into categories, making predictions from time series analysis, and using natural language processing to hunt for truths should be conducted as well.

The data in this analysis is from [Kaggle](https://www.kaggle.com/rush4ratio/video-game-sales-with-ratings) and data exploration/visualization was performed in [Google Sheets](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1IzZdD5ClFKuBHfWMm8PevlxuX4BXdM0G8yXqgQvV_LQ/edit?usp=sharing) and [Tableau](https://public.tableau.com/app/profile/rachel.goodridge#!/?newProfile=&activeTab=0).
